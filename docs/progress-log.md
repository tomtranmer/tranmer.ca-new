### Audit Recommendations (August 13, 2025)

A project-wide audit was conducted, focusing on performance, SEO, code organization, and accessibility. The following recommendations were made and subsequently implemented.

### 1. SEO & Metadata

-   **Change:** Updated the static metadata in `app/layout.tsx` to provide a descriptive title and meta description for the entire site.
-   **Reason:** To improve search engine visibility and ensure that the site has a meaningful presence in search results.
-   **Files Affected:**
    -   `app/layout.tsx`

### 2. Performance: Image Optimization

-   **Change:** Replaced static `<div>` backgrounds with the `next/image` component for photorealistic image assets (`landscape.jpg`).
-   **Reason:** To leverage Next.js's built-in image optimization, which includes lazy loading, automatic resizing, and format conversion (e.g., to WebP). This significantly improves loading performance and reduces bandwidth usage.
-   **Files Affected:**
    -   `app/page.tsx`

### 3. Code Organization: Component Extraction

-   **Change:** Decomposed the main landing page (`app/page.tsx`) into smaller, single-responsibility components.
-   **Reason:** This refactoring improves code modularity, readability, and reusability. It makes the codebase easier to maintain and scale.
-   **Files Affected:**
    -   `app/page.tsx` (refactored to be a simple container)
    -   `components/AppIcon.tsx` (created)
    -   `components/AppGrid.tsx` (created)
    -   `components/Dock.tsx` (created)
    -   `components/PhoneFrame.tsx` (created)

### 4. Accessibility: Theme Management

-   **Change:** Installed the `next-themes` library and implemented a `ThemeProvider` to manage dark and light modes across the application.
-   **Reason:** To provide a robust and accessible way for users to switch themes, persist their preference, and prevent the "flash of incorrect theme" (FOIT) on initial page load.
-   **Files Affected:**
    -   `package.json` / `package-lock.json` (added `next-themes`)
    -   `app/layout.tsx` (wrapped the root layout with the provider)
    -   `components/ThemeProvider.tsx` (created)

---

### 5. Workflow Cleanup

-   **Change:** Removed the `preview-deploy.yml` GitHub Actions workflow file.
-   **Reason:** Since Vercel automatically handles deployment on pushes to connected branches, the manual deployment trigger workflow was redundant. We kept the `ci.yml` workflow as it provides valuable code quality checks (linting, testing, building) that are independent of deployment.
-   **Files Affected:**
    -   `.github/workflows/preview-deploy.yml` (deleted)
