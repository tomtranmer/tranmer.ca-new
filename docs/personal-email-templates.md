# Personal Email Templates - Appstravaganza Campaign

## Day 1: Top Tier Clients (Wednesday, Sept 25)

**Subject**: Tom here - Your exclusive first look at Appstravaganza 2025

```
Hi [First Name],

I wanted to reach out to you personally before I announce this publicly.

You know how we've talked about [specific past project/challenge they mentioned]? Well, I've been thinking about that conversation, and I have something that might be perfect for you.

I'm launching something called "Appstravaganza" - a focused 1-week sprint where I build custom web apps for my best clients. Think of it as the app equivalent of what we did with your website, but condensed into an intensive week with immediate results.

Here's what makes this special:
• 20 hours of dedicated development time
• 3 structured meetings (planning, progress, polish)
• Production-ready code delivered via GitHub
• Hosting included for the first month
• $500 deposit, $500 on delivery (instead of the regular $2500)

I'm only doing this for existing clients first, and I wanted to give you the opportunity before I open it up. 

Would you be interested in a 15-minute call this week to discuss what kind of app would transform your business operations?

Best,
Tom

P.S. I'm limiting this to just 12 weeks through the end of the year. If you're interested, I'd love to get you on the calendar soon.

## Day 2: Mid-Tier Clients (Thursday, Sept 26)

**Subject**: Remember that app idea you mentioned? Let's build it in 1 week

```
Hi [First Name],

I was just reviewing our project notes from [previous project], and I came across something you mentioned about [specific app idea/business need they discussed].

At the time, we focused on getting your website launched, but I remember you saying something like "[quote their actual words about needing an app/tool]."

Well, I have some exciting news. I'm launching a new service called Appstravaganza - basically, I take that app idea that's been sitting on your back burner and build it in just one week.

Here's how it works:
• Week 1: I build your app (20 focused hours)
• You get 3 meetings with me: planning, progress check, and final polish
• Code delivered production-ready via GitHub
• Hosting included to get you started
• For existing clients like you: $500 to start, $500 when I deliver

I genuinely think this could solve that [specific problem they mentioned]. 

Want to hop on a quick call this week to explore if this makes sense for your business?

Talk soon,
Tom

P.S. I'm only doing 12 of these through year-end, so if this resonates, let's chat sooner rather than later.

## Day 3: Recent Website Clients (Friday, Sept 27)

**Subject**: Your website is live - now let's add the app that powers it

```
Hi [First Name],

How's the new website working out for you? I hope you're seeing the results we talked about during the project.

I've been thinking about our conversations during the build, especially when you mentioned [specific backend need/process improvement they discussed]. At the time, we focused on getting the website perfect, but I kept thinking about how much more powerful your business could be with the right tools behind the scenes.

That's actually why I'm reaching out. I just launched something called Appstravaganza - a 1-week intensive where I build custom web applications for my clients.

Think of it as the perfect complement to your new website. While your site handles the front-facing marketing, an app can handle the business operations that matter most to you.

For example, I could build you:
• A customer management system
• An internal tool for [specific process they mentioned]
• A booking/scheduling system integrated with your site
• [Other specific suggestion based on their business]

Since we just worked together and I already understand your business, this would be incredibly efficient. Plus, for existing clients like you, it's just $500 to get started, $500 on delivery.

Interested in a quick call to brainstorm what would make the biggest impact for your business?

Best,
Tom

P.S. I'm only doing 12 of these builds through the end of the year. Given how well our last project went, I'd love to reserve a spot for you if this interests you.

## Day 4: Team Management Clients (Saturday, Sept 28)

**Subject**: Weekend thought: What if your team pain points were solved by Monday?

```
Hi [First Name],

Hope you're having a good weekend!

I was just thinking about our conversation when we were working on [previous project], specifically when you mentioned how [specific team/operational challenge] was eating up so much of your time.

You said something like "[quote their frustration about manual processes/team coordination]" - and I remember thinking there had to be a better way.

Well, I might have found it.

I just launched something called Appstravaganza - a 1-week sprint where I build custom web apps that solve exactly these kinds of business pain points.

What if instead of [current manual process], your team had a simple app that:
• [Specific solution 1]
• [Specific solution 2]  
• [Specific solution 3]
• All accessible from any device, anytime

I could build this for you in just one week. Seriously.

Here's how it works:
• 20 hours of focused development
• 3 meetings: planning, progress, delivery
• Production-ready code you own completely
• For existing clients: $500 to start, $500 when complete

I genuinely think this could save you [X hours per week] and eliminate that frustration you mentioned.

Want to explore this on a quick call early next week?

Best,
Tom

P.S. Weekend projects have a way of becoming Monday morning game-changers. If this resonates, let's make it happen.

## Day 5: Creative/Entrepreneur Clients (Sunday, Sept 29)

**Subject**: Sunday spark: Turn your side project into reality this year

```
Hi [First Name],

Sunday afternoons are perfect for dreaming big, aren't they?

I was just thinking about our conversation during [previous project] when you mentioned that side project idea - [specific project/app they mentioned]. You had such passion when you described it, and I could tell it was something that could really take off.

You said the main barrier was [specific challenge they mentioned - usually time, technical skills, or knowing where to start].

Well, I have some Sunday inspiration for you.

I just launched Appstravaganza - a 1-week intensive where I take ideas exactly like yours and turn them into real, working web applications.

Instead of letting another year pass thinking "someday I'll build that," what if it was live and generating results by next weekend?

Here's what I'm offering:
• One focused week - 20 hours of development
• Your idea becomes a production-ready web app
• Code delivered via GitHub (you own it completely)
• Hosting included to get you started
• For existing clients like you: $500 to start, $500 when I deliver

I genuinely believe [their specific idea] has real potential. The question is: do you want to spend 2026 still thinking about it, or start 2026 with it already generating results?

Want to turn that Sunday spark into Monday action? Let's chat this week.

Cheers,
Tom

P.S. I'm only doing 12 of these builds through year-end. If you've been waiting for a sign to finally build [their project], consider this it.

## Follow-up Email Template (3-5 days after initial)

**Subject**: Following up on Appstravaganza - Quick question

```
Hi [First Name],

I wanted to follow up on my email from [day] about Appstravaganza.

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short:

If you could wave a magic wand and have one custom web app built for your business - something that would save you time, make you money, or eliminate a daily frustration - what would it be?

That's essentially what I'm offering to build in one week.

If you have 2 minutes to reply with even a rough idea, I can tell you if it's something I could tackle in the Appstravaganza format.

No pressure - just curious if this resonates with where your business is right now.

Best,
Tom

P.S. Already have 3 weeks booked, so the calendar is filling up. But I'd love to reserve a spot for you if this makes sense.

## Response Templates for Common Situations

### When they say "Interested but not sure what to build":
```
That's exactly why I built in the planning meeting! 

Here's what I typically see work best for businesses like yours:
[2-3 specific suggestions based on their industry/previous conversations]

Want to hop on a 15-minute call where I can ask a few questions about your current processes? I bet I can identify 2-3 app ideas that would make a real impact.

No commitment required - just brainstorming.
```

### When they ask about timeline:
```
Great question! Here are the available weeks I have left in 2025:

[List actual available weeks]

The beauty of the 1-week format is we can move fast. From booking to delivery is typically 2-3 weeks total (depending on when you want to start).

Which timeframe works best for your schedule?
```

### When they're concerned about scope:
```
I totally understand - scope creep is real! 

That's why I've structured this with clear boundaries:
• 20 hours max development time
• 3 meetings to keep us aligned
• Focus on one primary function/workflow

Think of it as "Version 1.0" - a working solution that solves your core problem. If you love it and want to add features later, we can always discuss Phase 2.

The goal is to deliver something immediately useful, not necessarily everything you might eventually want.

Does that approach make sense for what you're thinking about?
```
